      To go to Iahgnahs.<br>
      A place that I have only been for once.<br>
      I stayed there for nearly a month.<br>
      One day, I remember,<br>
      Was a bright, sunny spring.<br>
      I woke up late, and my plan was to wander around the place I lived.<br>
<br>
      Iahgnhs was – <br>
      Rather not so different from other places,<br>
      But with only one law changed:<br>
      Everything was up-side-down.<br>
      In Iahgnahs, sky and cloud are what you step on.<br>
      A clear, blue sheet, with countless pure white marshmallows.<br>
      If you raise your head,<br>
      Cars, bicycles, scooters;<br>
      And a black asphalt high upon.<br>
<br>
      Oops, back to my trip that day.<br>
<br>
      I checked all the things that I need to take:<br>
      Not keys, backpacks, earphones;<br>
      But a pen, a notebook, and an empty mind for such a joy.<br>
<br>
      I walked out of my room,<br>
      Pressed the “downward” button of the elevator.<br>
      As the steel door closed, I was captured within a tiny black box.<br>
      On each of the three walls surrounding me, there was a piece of advertisement.<br>
      On which there were three young, beautiful ladies smiling, representing their products.<br>
      They all looked similar,<br>
      Perfect faces, perfect body shapes, and a charming smile.<br>
      My landlady, a middle-aged kind woman, once told me,<br>
      That everybody she knew hates such ads.<br>
      The ads in the elevator should be and has been a place for<br>
      Galleries, bookstores, theatres, and young artists<br>
      Since she was a little girl.<br>
      Unfortunately, someone broke the tradition and turned them into – <br>
      “<i>disgusting modern assembly-line-made fast food craps.</i>” she said.<br>
<br>
      I walked out of the building,<br>
      Playing my favourite game as everyone else on the road:<br>
<br><i>
      “Tip your toe,<br>
      Clouds move slow,<br>
      Hop in the air,<br>
      And land on your own!<br>
      <br>
      Land on the white,<br>
      Don’t step on the blue!<br>
      What if you do?<br>
      Never mind and Start again!”<br>
</i><br>
      I went to an old block near a river.<br>
      Where someone told me that merchants would gather.<br>
      Old riverside factories turned into markets,<br>
      Bizarre bazaars sell things that are bizarre!<br>
      I looked around,<br>
      Old building, old river, with new life and new idea.<br>
      The telegraph poles, <br>
      the wires are hanging.<br>
      With some branches of willow,<br>
      That are shaking and swinging.<br>
      It was early in the spring,<br>
      So the leaves were not here.<br>
      Only little green dots,<br>
      That merges with the scene.<br>
      Iahgnahs, a strange place,<br>
      Were old industrial elements,<br>
      could live long with the nature.<br>
<br>
      I walked out of the block,<br>
      Feeling a little tired.<br>
      Probably that was the time I’ve decided to end the trip for that day.<br>
      Since when I was also captured by such a Iahgnahsese style of living?<br>
      Iahgnahsese could start a trip everywhere,<br>
      And could end it everywhere.<br>
      They could throw away their works whenever they felt tired,<br>
      Or end a trip before they reach the destination,<br>
      Just because they were happy already.<br>
<br>
      I have been to Iahgnahs for once, and only for once.<br>
      I love the town, since the first second I reach that place.<br>
      But I never managed to find the way there since my last trip.<br>
      Because on that day when I tried to jump and reach my hand for a balloon falling towards me,<br>
      I woke up from my dream<br>
      ---- and yes, it’s a dream.<br>
      For such a place can only exist in a dream.<br>
