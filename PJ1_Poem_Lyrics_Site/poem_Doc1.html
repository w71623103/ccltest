      Nothing is coming into my mind.<br>
      At the time when I need to write.<br>
      My mind is empty and my eyes are blind.<br>
      <br>
      Why not write about beauty of mankind?<br>
      But I cannot think of a theme that is right.<br>
      Nothing is coming into my mind.<br>
      <br>
      How about a land that is only in your mind?<br>
      But the way towards there was already blight.<br>
      My mind is empty and my eyes are blind.<br>
      <br>
      Music of words is hiding inside my head,<br>
      Refusing me while I’m struggling for a rhyme.<br>
      Nothing is coming into my mind.<br>
      <br>
      Deadline is approaching to its time.<br>
      With the clock running towards late night.<br>
      My mind is empty and my eyes are blind.<br>
      <br>
      Starting from when, writing becomes like a grind?<br>
      I’m throwing words out, one by one in byte.<br>
      Nothing is coming into my mind.<br>
      My mind is empty and my eyes are blind.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
