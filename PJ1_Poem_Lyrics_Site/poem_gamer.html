      I am a person who is the same as everyone else;<br>
      A Homo Sapiens who lives alone.<br>
      Seven feet height,<br>
    <!-- </p>

    <p class="poem"> -->
      Two hundred pounds weight.<br>
      I can walk, I can talk, I can eat.<br>
      I can laugh, I can cry, I can shout.<br>
      But my shouting is always missed,<br>
      For the one who heard never cared.<br>
      “You’re just a ‘one’ who differs from the ‘mass’.”<br>
      “Who cares about your interest, your doubt, or your rage?”<br>
      Rage, rage!<br>
      But rage is the ending on my stage.<br>
      After raging, what can I change?<br>
      Hum,<br>
      I guess only the minutes that was added on my age.<br>

      ~Welcome to Game! ~<br>
      <br>
      I am a person who is not myself.<br>
      A Homo Ludens who sits in my realm.<br>
      A magic circle distinguishes my state,<br>
      When sitting inside, I am on my game.<br>
      In the game, I am no more a No One.<br>
      I am the center under the dome;<br>
      I am the hero who fights the doom.<br>
      I can run, I can jump, I can fly.<br>
      I can build, I can break, I can shout.<br>
      In the game, my shouting won’t be missed.<br>
      For the sight of the creatures in game are fixed<br>
      Precisely on my Avatar.<br>
      Outside the game, they curse me as a “NEET”;<br>
      Inside the game, they praise me as a “Hero”.<br>
      <br>
      I’m a gamer, a sick Gamer.<br>
      A Gamer who dislikes real life.<br>
      The game gives me a shelter.<br>
      Entering the shelter, I become anyone I want.<br>
      And do anything I want.<br>
    </p>
